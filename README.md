Hi,  
  
Big thanks to [fixer](https://ghost.slack.com/team/fixer) for sharing this setup. He managed to make Ghost Alpha work on his setup. It’s not perfect but it’s a start. 

Here are his comments:

```
Well my setup has multiple weak points. A) downloads lateat alpha from an url generated by my api (wrapper for github api)

So as ive said earlier its a quick & dirty kind of thing

Also the way im using env vars is a little messed up because of my current setup (using the image on heroku,openshift & local dev cluster

Its still good enough for testing  but i dont tudod nk its good enough for the official image
