Hi,  
  
Big thanks to [fixer](https://ghost.slack.com/team/fixer) for sharing this setup. It’s not perfect but it’s a start. 

Here are his comments:

```
Well my setup has multiple weak points.
A) downloads lateat alpha from an url generated by my api (wrapper for github api)

Also the way im using env vars is a little messed up because of my current setup (using the image on heroku,openshift & local dev cluster
```

Easy try out!

```
docker run -d --name=ghostalpha -e PORT=2368 -p:2368:2368 fixer/ghostfixer:alpha
```
